# Wineshop
# Ruby on Rails 4 App - Full CRUD

[![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/iposton/wineshop/badges/gpa.svg)](https://codeclimate.com/github/iposton/wineshop)

  This app allows you to add a wine, the wine type, what region it's from and the year. It is stored in MongoDB. There is a seperate model called store you can save the id of store in a wine upon create. This was to practice model relationships. I used bootstrap and pure to style the views and forms. This was a project from week 4 while at WDI so that I could practice, create, read, update, destroy. Most web apps we use today use this practical functionality.
